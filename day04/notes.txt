hcl 11
ecl 06
pid 25
cid 10

List of assumptions made:
- all keys are 3 chars
- the xor or the first two bytes of the key are unique
- no other keys will appear besides the ones in the input
- no input line is more than 98 chars
- Hash of the eye color is sum of first and last chars

...and this is sufficient (for my input)

This might actually be shorter if I just rolled my own strcmp.
